What Is The Business Problem The App Is Solving?

During the campaign creative setup, clients would often provide a list of creative files and websites. Account managers would need to bulk import creatives by filling out the template spreadsheet. The spreadsheet needs to include the following columns:

Names: usually contain information such as campaign name, file size, advertiser name, and campaign regions which need to change for each line
Asset File Name: same file name might appear several times for the same creatives
Clickthrough URL & Clickthrough URL:Â  many short character fields need to be replaced several times

This manual typing process is often complex, involves too many "copy and paste" commands, and can take hours if many creative files and long website URLs are involved.
